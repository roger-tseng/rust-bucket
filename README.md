# Rust Bucket
My first programming project done for Computer Programming class in Fall 2018, a simplified recreation of Rust Bucket in Python using Pygame.
[Rust Bucket](http://www.nitrome.com/games/rustbucket/) is a turn-based roguelike minigame developed by Nitrome. The original game has both a pre-made level-based mode and an endless mode with procedurally generated dungeons, both of which are implemented in this version.

# Requirements
[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org) must be installed.
```bash
pip install pygame
git clone https://github.com/roger-tseng/rust-bucket.git
cd rust-bucket
python3 FinalVersion.py
```
